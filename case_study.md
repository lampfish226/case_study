## Brainstorm questions

- Where are max and min air bnb prices?
  - What are average prices?
  - What factors affect prices?
- Where are prices going up and down over time?
- What’s the relationship between number of reviews and average review?
- Does room type affect availability?
- What’s the location of the unit?
  - What areas are popular?
  - Popularity = number of units? Average price?
- Are there repeat hosts?
  - If so, what does that mean?
